This folder contains scripts used for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).
This type of analysis is typically used to look for correlations between changes in gene expression and other changes (e.g. changes in methylation or chromatin accessibility).
gsea_example_script.R contains the script to run a GSEA analysis, while the other files are files that would be required to run the analysis in the script.
